# Bootstrap UI
Generating Dynamic HTML UI with Bootstrap framework. 

Have you been in a situation in which you need to build a UI or MVC but are dragged into learning some big framework or some new technology completely? I have found myself juggling between iOS/Java/HTML/Angular and different types of HTML frameworks. There are a lot of frameworks which produce responsive web-pages and are mobile ready. However, only a few come close to Bootstrap. This framework is really simple, very complete and very well supported.
